                        <p><strong>Effective Communication:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Interpersonal skills play a major role in communicating correctly. Be careful with the choice of words or language you use. It’s okay to lose your temper in some situations, but ensure you don’t lose your dignity. To deal with anger situations, practice your articulation. Learn to speak slowly without raising your voice. Pick the right words and be firm when you talk. This will help you become an effective communicator, which adds to your overall personality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learn to Dress well:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Here we do not mean that you need to buy expensive branded clothes. But dress according to the situation. For example, if you appearing for a job interview, wear formal clothes with light or neutral makeup to leave lasting impressions on the employer. Tidy and neat clothing appeals and makes a fine impression.</p>
                        <p><strong>Have Emotional control:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Decisions taken in the flares of emotions are likely to turn incorrect. You must control your emotions and be sound all the time. By the word ‘emotions’ we mean different kind of feelings that we experience within us such as love, pride, happiness, guilt, anxiety, loneliness, anger, regret, excitement, shame, etc. Emotions are the chief influencing factors behind the every decision, work and task but if not controlled properly, they can bring potential harm to the things.</p>
                        <p><strong>Accept every individual is unique:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Remember that every human being is special and has his/ her unique nature and behavior. Comparing yourself with others around only increases the agony, particularly when you focus where you are deficient compared to others. It is significant that you channelize your power towards your optimistic traits. Never try to imitate others and be the one which you are in actual.</p>
                        <p><strong>Personality is not genetic:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Every individual develops a personality on their own. An introvert father can have an extrovert child. A mother with positive personality can give birth to the child with negative personality. Personality is developed along with our physical, mental and emotional growth, and it has nothing to do with our genes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Take a personality check:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">There are some tests that can help you measure your personality. These tests gauge your personality based on your responses to several questions. You may be asked to complete a sentence or describe a situation. The purpose of these tests is to analyze your reactions and responses, your thinking and feelings. Your personality is calculated by merely analyzing your thoughts and feeling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Be a Social Animal:</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Just because you feel you aren’t good-looking, do not avoid meeting people. Look for opportunities, go to different events, participate in social gatherings and be proactive</p>
