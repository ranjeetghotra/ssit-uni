                        <p class="text-justify">Sri Sai Institute of Technology is entering into the process of admissions for the new academic session. During a short span, the Institute has shaped into a full grown, mature and responsible organization. It has carved a niche for itself in the professional education fraternity of the region.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The responsibilities of institutes in India have increased. Besides training young professionals to meet the above challenges, the Indian corporate ethos is also to be kept in mind. I am very confident to assure the prospective entrants to this Institute that we are determined to respond to the expectations of the society and the industry in a perfect and organized way. Our faculty shall leave no stone unturned to help the students to develop into right thinking, full grown, mature and responsible corporate citizens. I welcome you to the Institute and wish you all the very best for your future endeavors.</p>
