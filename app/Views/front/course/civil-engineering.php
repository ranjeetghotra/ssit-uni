                                        Civil Engineering is a Professional Engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction and maintenance of the physical
                                        and naturally built environment, including works such as bridges, roads, canals, dams and buildings. It is traditionally broken
                                        into several sub-disciplines including Environmental Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Structural Engineering, Transportation
                                        Engineering, Municipal or Urban Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Materials Engineering, Coastal Engineering, Surveying
                                        and Construction Engineering. Civil engineering takes place on all levels: in the Public Sector ranging from Municipal to Federal
                                        levels, and in the Private Sector ranging from individual homeowners to international companies.<br>
