                        <h2><p>It plays a vital role in an engineering discipline, catering to the teaching of basic Sciences for students of all branches offered by college (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil Engg).
The purpose of applied sciences in Engineering study is to lay a strong foundation of basic principles of various disciplines such as <strong>Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Communication Skills and Engineering Drawing</strong> in the mind of the learners, so that they proceed to rest of their years of study with up to date knowledge and training of basic engineering skills.</p>
                            <p>Our Laboratories are very well established .We not only to cover complete syllabus but also motivate students to learn beyond the syllabus which definitely develops complete knowledge of the subject (both the practical and theoretical depth of knowledge) and develop skill sets of students to become promising engineers in future, thus the Department of Applied Sciences (1st year Department) acts as a fertilizer to develop a good base for studentâ€™s, personality and skills.</p>
                            <p>This is the backbone of all disciplines in Engineering and Technology.</p>
                            <p>I wish success and bright future to all the students.</p>
